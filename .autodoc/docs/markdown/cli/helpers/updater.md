The code in this file is responsible for managing updates to the Aleo project. It provides functionality to check for updates, display available releases, and update the project to the latest release. The `Updater` struct is the main component of this file, and it contains several associated functions.

`show_available_releases()` is a function that fetches and displays a list of available releases for the Aleo project. It uses the `github::ReleaseList` struct to fetch the releases from the AleoHQ/aleo GitHub repository.

```rust
pub fn show_available_releases() -> Result<String> { ... }
```

`update_to_latest_release(show_output: bool)` is a function that updates the Aleo project to the latest release. It uses the `github::Update` struct to perform the update, and it takes a boolean parameter `show_output` to control whether the update progress should be displayed.

```rust
pub fn update_to_latest_release(show_output: bool) -> Result<Status, UpdaterError> { ... }
```

`update_available()` is a function that checks if there is an available update for the Aleo project. It returns the newest release version if an update is available, or an error if the current version is already the latest.

```rust
pub fn update_available() -> Result<String, UpdaterError> { ... }
```

`print_cli()` is a function that displays a CLI message informing the user if a new version is available. If an update is available, it prompts the user to run `aleo update` to update to the latest version.

```rust
pub fn print_cli() -> String { ... }
```

These functions can be used in the larger Aleo project to manage updates and ensure users are running the latest version of the software.

2. **Question**: How does the `update_to_latest_release` method work and what are its parameters?
