This code defines an `Account` enum with four variants: `New`, `Import`, `Encrypt`, and `Decrypt`. Each variant represents a command to manage Aleo account creation, import, and encryption/decryption. The `Account` enum also implements a `parse` method that executes the corresponding command based on the variant.

- `New`: Generates a new Aleo account with an optional seed, encryption flag, and write flag. If the encryption flag is set, the private key is encrypted using a password provided or prompted from the user. If the write flag is set, the account keys are written to a file.
- `Import`: Imports an Aleo account from a given private key and writes the account keys to a file if the write flag is set.
- `Encrypt`: Encrypts a private key either provided directly or read from a file. The encrypted private key is written to a file if the write flag is set.
- `Decrypt`: Decrypts a private key ciphertext either provided directly or read from a file. The decrypted private key is written to a file if the write flag is set.

Example usage:

```rust
let account = Account::New { seed: None, encrypt: false, write: false, password: None };
let result = account.parse();
```

The code also includes tests to ensure the correct functionality of each command and their combinations, such as creating, importing, encrypting, and decrypting accounts from files or command-line inputs.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `encrypt_with_password` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `encrypt_with_password` function is used to encrypt a private key using a given password. It takes a reference to a private key and an optional password as input. If the password is provided, it is used to encrypt the private key. If the password is not provided, the user is prompted to enter a password, which is then used to encrypt the private key.

2. **Question**: How does the `write_account_to_file` function work and what are its inputs?
   **Answer**: The `write_account_to_file` function is used to write account keys to a file. It takes a boolean flag `write`, an optional private key ciphertext, an optional private key, an optional view key, and an optional address as input. If the `write` flag is set to true, the function checks if the file already exists. If it does not exist, it creates a new file and writes the account keys in JSON format. If the file already exists, it returns an error message indicating that the file already exists.

3. **Question**: How does the `parse` function work and what are the different cases it handles?
   **Answer**: The `parse` function is used to process the different subcommands related to Aleo account management, such as creating a new account, importing an existing account, encrypting a private key, and decrypting a private key ciphertext. It takes an instance of the `Account` enum as input and matches it with the corresponding subcommand. Depending on the subcommand, it performs the required operations and returns the result as a formatted string.
