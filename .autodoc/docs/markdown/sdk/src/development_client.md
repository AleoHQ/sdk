The code defines a `DevelopmentClient` class that provides a JavaScript/TypeScript API for interacting with an Aleo Development Server. The client sends RESTful requests to the server and returns the resulting transaction_id. The Aleo Development Server is responsible for running proving and verification operations needed to deploy and execute programs on the Aleo Network.

The `DevelopmentClient` class has three main methods:

1. `deployProgram`: Deploys a program on the Aleo Network via an Aleo development server. It takes parameters such as the program text, fee, private key, password, and fee record. Example usage:

```javascript
const Program = 'program yourprogram.aleo;...';
const client = new DevelopmentClient("http://0.0.0.0:4040");
const transaction_id = await client.deployProgram(Program, 6000000, privateKeyString);
```

2. `executeProgram`: Executes a program on the Aleo Network via an Aleo development server. It takes parameters such as the program ID, program function, fee, inputs, private key, password, and fee record. Example usage:

```javascript
const privateKey = "your private key";
const client = new DevelopmentClient("http://0.0.0.0:4040");
const transaction_id = await client.executeProgram("hello.aleo", "main", 0, ["5u32", "5u32"], privateKeyString);
```

3. `transfer`: Sends an amount in credits to a specified recipient on the Aleo Network via an Aleo development server. It takes parameters such as the amount, fee, recipient, private key, password, fee record, and amount record. Example usage:

```javascript
const privateKey = "your private key";
const recipient = "recipient's address";
const client = new DevelopmentClient("http://0.0.0.0:4040");
const transaction_id = await client.transfer(1.5, 0, recipient, privateKey);
```

These methods internally use the `sendRequest` method to send POST requests to the Aleo Development Server with the appropriate request data and headers.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `sendRequest` function and how is it used in the other functions?**

   The `sendRequest` function is a generic function that sends a POST request to the specified path with the given request data. It is used by the `deployProgram`, `executeProgram`, and `transfer` functions to send requests to the Aleo Development Server.

2. **How are optional parameters handled in the `DeployRequest`, `ExecuteRequest`, and `TransferRequest` interfaces?**

   Optional parameters are denoted with a question mark (`?`) in the interfaces. If an optional parameter is not provided, it will be set to `undefined` by default.

3. **What is the purpose of the `fee` parameter in the `deployProgram`, `executeProgram`, and `transfer` functions, and how is it used?**

   The `fee` parameter represents the fee to be paid for the respective transactions (program deployment, program execution, or transfer). It is a required parameter and is multiplied by 1,000,000 before being included in the request object to be sent to the Aleo Development Server.
