The `AleoNetworkClient` class in this code is responsible for managing connections and making REST calls to publicly exposed endpoints of Aleo nodes. It provides methods to interact with the Aleo blockchain, such as fetching blocks, transactions, and other relevant information.

To create a connection to a local or public Aleo node, you can instantiate the `AleoNetworkClient` class with the appropriate host URL:

```javascript
let local_connection = new AleoNetworkClient("http://localhost:3030");
let public_connection = new AleoNetworkClient("https://vm.aleo.org/api");
```

The class also allows setting and getting an `Account` object, which represents an Aleo account:

```javascript
let account = new Account();
connection.setAccount(account);
let account = connection.getAccount();
```

Various methods are provided to fetch information from the Aleo blockchain, such as:

- `getBlock(height: number)`: Fetches the block contents at the specified block height.
- `getBlockRange(start: number, end: number)`: Fetches a range of blocks between the specified block heights.
- `getProgram(programId: string)`: Fetches the source code of a program.
- `getLatestBlock()`: Fetches the block contents of the latest block.
- `getLatestHash()`: Fetches the hash of the last published block.
- `getLatestHeight()`: Fetches the latest block height.
- `getStateRoot()`: Fetches the latest state/merkle root of the Aleo blockchain.
- `getTransaction(id: string)`: Fetches a transaction by its unique identifier.
- `getTransactions(height: number)`: Fetches the transactions present at the specified block height.
- `getTransactionsInMempool()`: Fetches the transactions in the memory pool.
- `getTransitionId(transition_id: string)`: Fetches the transition id by its unique identifier.

Additionally, the `findUnspentRecords` method allows finding unspent records in the Aleo blockchain for a specified private key, with optional parameters to filter the results:

```javascript
const privateKey = "[PRIVATE_KEY]";
let records = connection.findUnspentRecords(0, undefined, privateKey);
```

Overall, the `AleoNetworkClient` class serves as a convenient interface for interacting with the Aleo blockchain, making it easier for developers to build applications on top of the Aleo platform.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `fetchData<Type>(url?: string)` method, and how is it used within the class?
   **Answer**: The `fetchData<Type>(url?: string)` method is a generic method for making REST calls to the specified URL and returning the response as a Promise of the specified type. It is used internally by other methods in the `AleoNetworkClient` class to fetch data from the Aleo node endpoints.

2. **Question**: How does the `setAccount(account: Account)` method work, and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `setAccount(account: Account)` method sets the `account` property of the `AleoNetworkClient` class to the provided `Account` object. This allows the user to associate an Aleo account with the connection, which can be used for various operations on the Aleo blockchain.

3. **Question**: What is the expected behavior of the `findUnspentRecords` method, and what are the different use cases for its optional parameters?
   **Answer**: The `findUnspentRecords` method attempts to find unspent records in the Aleo blockchain for a specified private key. The optional parameters allow users to customize the search by specifying a range of block heights (`startHeight` and `endHeight`), specific amounts to search for (`amounts`), and a maximum number of cumulative microcredits (`maxMicrocredits`). These options enable users to narrow down their search for unspent records based on their requirements.
