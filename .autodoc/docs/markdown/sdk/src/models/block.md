This code is responsible for defining the structure of a block and its components in the Aleo project. The Aleo project is a blockchain-based platform, and this code is crucial for maintaining the integrity and organization of the blockchain.

The `Block` type is the primary structure defined in this code. It consists of the following properties:

- `block_hash`: A unique identifier for the block, generated by hashing its contents.
- `previous_hash`: The hash of the previous block in the chain, ensuring the blocks are linked together.
- `header`: Contains metadata and information about the block's contents.
- `transactions`: An optional array of `Transaction` objects, representing the transactions included in the block.
- `signature`: A cryptographic signature that validates the block's contents and ensures its authenticity.

The `Header` type is a substructure of the `Block` type and includes the following properties:

- `previous_state_root`: A hash representing the state of the blockchain before this block was added.
- `transactions_root`: A hash of all the transactions included in the block, ensuring their integrity.
- `metadata`: Additional information about the block, such as network details and timestamps.

The `Metadata` type is another substructure, containing the following properties:

- `network`: An identifier for the blockchain network this block belongs to.
- `round`: The current round of consensus for the block.
- `height`: The position of the block in the blockchain.
- `coinbase_target`: The target value for the coinbase transaction, which rewards the miner for creating the block.
- `proof_target`: The target value for the proof-of-work algorithm, ensuring the block's validity.
- `timestamp`: The time at which the block was created.

In the larger Aleo project, this code is used to create and validate new blocks as they are added to the blockchain. For example, when a new block is mined, it will be constructed using the `Block` type, with its `header` and `metadata` properties set according to the current state of the network. The block's `transactions` array will be populated with the transactions to be included in the block, and the `signature` will be generated to validate the block's contents.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `Block` type?**

   The `Block` type represents a block in the Aleo blockchain, containing properties such as the block hash, previous hash, header, transactions, and signature.

2. **What is the role of the `Header` and `Metadata` types?**

   The `Header` type contains information about the block's state and transactions, while the `Metadata` type holds additional details about the block, such as network, round, height, and various targets.

3. **How are the `Transaction` objects stored in the `Block` type?**

   The `Transaction` objects are stored as an optional array of `Transaction` type within the `Block` type, under the `transactions` property.
