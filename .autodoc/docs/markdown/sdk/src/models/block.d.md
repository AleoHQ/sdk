This code defines the structure of a block in the Aleo project, which is a blockchain-based platform. The block structure is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain. The code consists of three main types: `Block`, `Header`, and `Metadata`.

The `Block` type represents a single block in the blockchain and contains the following properties:

- `block_hash`: A unique string representing the hash of the block.
- `previous_hash`: A string representing the hash of the previous block in the chain.
- `header`: An object of type `Header` containing additional information about the block.
- `transactions`: An optional array of `Transaction` objects, representing the transactions included in the block.
- `signature`: A string representing the digital signature of the block, used for validation purposes.

The `Header` type contains information about the block and its contents. It has the following properties:

- `previous_state_root`: A string representing the root hash of the previous block's state.
- `transactions_root`: A string representing the root hash of the transactions included in the block.
- `metadata`: An object of type `Metadata` containing additional information about the block.

The `Metadata` type provides further details about the block, such as:

- `network`: A number representing the network ID.
- `round`: A number representing the round number in the consensus algorithm.
- `height`: A number representing the height of the block in the blockchain.
- `coinbase_target`: A number representing the target value for the coinbase transaction (i.e., the reward for mining the block).
- `proof_target`: A number representing the target value for the proof-of-work algorithm.
- `timestamp`: A number representing the timestamp of the block creation.

These types are used throughout the Aleo project to create, validate, and manipulate blocks in the blockchain. For example, when a new block is mined, it will be created as an instance of the `Block` type, with its properties set according to the current state of the blockchain and the transactions it contains. The block's `Header` and `Metadata` will also be populated with the relevant information, ensuring the block is correctly linked to the previous block and contains the necessary data for validation and consensus.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `Block` type?**

   The `Block` type represents a block in the Aleo blockchain, containing properties like block hash, previous hash, header, transactions, and signature.

2. **How are transactions stored in the `Block` type?**

   Transactions are stored as an optional array of `Transaction` objects in the `transactions` property of the `Block` type.

3. **What information is contained in the `Metadata` type?**

   The `Metadata` type contains information about the network, round, height, coinbase target, proof target, and timestamp for a block in the Aleo blockchain.
