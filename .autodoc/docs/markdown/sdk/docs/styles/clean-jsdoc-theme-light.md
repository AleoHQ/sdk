This code is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that defines the styling for the "light" theme of the Aleo project. The purpose of this code is to provide a visually appealing and consistent appearance for the user interface elements, such as text, links, buttons, and backgrounds, when the light theme is selected.

The code is organized into sections, each targeting specific elements or groups of elements in the project. For example, the `.light a, .light a:active` section defines the color of links and active links in the light theme. Similarly, the `.light .sidebar` section sets the background color and text color for the sidebar.

Some sections target more specific elements, such as headings (`.light h1, .light h2, ...`), tables (`.light table td, .light .params td`), and code blocks (`.light .hljs-comment, .light .hljs-quote`). These sections ensure that the appearance of these elements is consistent with the overall light theme.

The code also includes styling for interactive elements, such as buttons and tooltips. For example, the `.light .icon-button:hover` section defines the background color when a user hovers over an icon button. The `.light .tooltip` section sets the background and text color for tooltips.

In the larger project, this CSS file would be applied when the user selects the light theme, providing a cohesive and visually appealing appearance for the user interface. The code ensures that all elements, from text and links to buttons and tooltips, are styled consistently and in line with the chosen theme.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `.light` class and its related styles in this code?
   **Answer**: The `.light` class and its related styles are used to define the appearance of various elements in the light theme of the Aleo project. This includes setting background colors, text colors, and other styling properties for different elements like headers, links, tables, and code blocks.

2. **Question**: How are the colors for syntax highlighting in code blocks defined in the `.light` theme?
   **Answer**: The colors for syntax highlighting in code blocks are defined using the `.light .hljs-*` classes, where `*` represents different code elements like comments, keywords, strings, etc. Each class sets the `color` property to a specific color value for that element in the light theme.

3. **Question**: How does the `.light` theme handle styling for tooltips and scrollbars?
   **Answer**: The `.light` theme styles tooltips using the `.light .tooltip` class, which sets the background color and text color for tooltips. For scrollbars, the `.light ::-webkit-scrollbar-track` and `.light ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` classes are used to style the scrollbar track and thumb, respectively, with specific background colors and outlines.
