This code is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that defines the styling and appearance of various HTML elements in the Aleo project. The purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and visually appealing design across the entire project.

The CSS file covers a wide range of elements, including text, links, headings, sidebars, navigation bars, footers, tables, code blocks, blockquotes, and search components. It also includes styling for syntax highlighting in code blocks using the `hljs` (highlight.js) library.

For example, the `body` element has a dark background color (`#1a1a1a`) and white text color (`#fff`). Links (`a` elements) have a blue color (`#00bbff`) and change to a darker blue when active. Headings (`h1` to `h6`) have a white color.

The sidebar has a dark background color (`#222`) and a lighter text color (`#999`). When hovering over a sidebar section title, the background color changes to `#252525`. The navigation bar has a similar dark background color (`#1a1a1a`) and lighter text/icons color (`#999`). When hovering over a navigation item, the background color changes to `#202020`.

Code blocks have a dark background color (`#333`) and use various colors for syntax highlighting, such as `#ff7b72` for keywords and `#30ac7c` for template variables.

The CSS file also includes styling for scrollbars, with a dark track color (`#333`) and a slightly lighter thumb color (`#555`).

Overall, this CSS file contributes to the Aleo project by providing a visually appealing and consistent design for various elements, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the project.
