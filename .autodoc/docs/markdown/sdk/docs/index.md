This code is an HTML file that serves as the main entry point for the Aleo SDK documentation website. The Aleo SDK provides high-level utilities in JavaScript for handling Accounts, Records, and Node connections in the browser. It uses the `@aleohq/wasm` package under the hood.

The file contains the following sections:

1. **Header**: The header includes meta tags, title, and external script and stylesheet references. It also contains SVG symbol definitions that are used as icons throughout the website.

2. **Body**: The body is divided into several parts:
   - Sidebar: Contains navigation links to different sections of the documentation, such as Classes (Account, AleoNetworkClient, DevelopmentClient).
   - Navbar: Contains buttons for search, theme toggle, and font size adjustment.
   - Table of Contents: Displays a list of headings on the current page.
   - Main Content: Displays the content of the documentation, including a brief introduction to the Aleo SDK, build guide, and links to related Aleo tools and repositories.
   - Search Container: Provides a search functionality for the documentation.
   - Mobile Menu: Contains a button to toggle the mobile sidebar and navigation links.

3. **Scripts**: The file includes several JavaScript files for handling the core functionality, search, and table of contents. The `tocbot` library is used to generate the table of contents, and the `fuse.js` library is used for search functionality.

This file serves as a starting point for users to explore the Aleo SDK documentation and learn how to use the SDK in their projects.
