This code is responsible for implementing a search functionality in the Aleo project. It provides an interactive search experience by fetching data, filtering results based on user input, and displaying the results in a user-friendly manner.

The main functions in this code are:

1. `showResultText(text)`: Displays the given text in the `resultBox` element.
2. `hideSearch()`: Hides the search container and removes the event listener for the 'Escape' key.
3. `listenCloseKey(event)`: Listens for the 'Escape' key press and hides the search container when pressed.
4. `showSearch()`: Displays the search container, adds the event listener for the 'Escape' key, and focuses on the search input.
5. `fetchAllData()`: Fetches the search data from the server and returns it as a list.
6. `onClickSearchItem(event)`: Handles the click event on a search result item and brings the corresponding element into view.
7. `buildSearchResult(result)`: Builds the HTML output for the search results.
8. `getSearchResult(list, keys, searchKey)`: Filters the search data based on the given search key and returns the filtered results.
9. `debounce(func, wait, immediate)`: Debounces the given function to prevent excessive calls.
10. `search(event)`: Handles the search functionality by fetching data, filtering results, and displaying them in the `resultBox`.

The code also includes event listeners for DOMContentLoaded and hashchange events. The `onDomContentLoaded()` function initializes the search functionality by adding event listeners to the search button, search container, search wrapper, and search input. The hashchange event listener calls the `showSearch()` function when the window location hash matches the `searchHash`.

Here's an example of how the search functionality works:

1. User clicks on the search button, triggering the `showSearch()` function.
2. The search container is displayed, and the search input is focused.
3. User types a query in the search input, triggering the debounced `search()` function.
4. The search function fetches data, filters results based on the query, and displays the results in the `resultBox`.
5. User clicks on a search result item, triggering the `onClickSearchItem()` function, which brings the corresponding element into view.
6. User presses the 'Escape' key or clicks outside the search wrapper, triggering the `hideSearch()` function, which hides the search container.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `searchId` and `searchHash` constants?
   **Answer:** The `searchId` constant is a unique identifier for the search feature, and `searchHash` is created by concatenating a hash symbol with the `searchId`. These constants are used to manage the browser's history and hash change events when showing or hiding the search feature.

2. **Question:** How does the `fetchAllData` function work, and what does it return?
   **Answer:** The `fetchAllData` function fetches search data from a JSON file located at `data/search.json` relative to the base URL. It returns a Promise that resolves to an array of search data items (the `list` property of the fetched JSON object).

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `debounce` function, and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer:** The `debounce` function is a utility function that limits the rate at which a function can be called. It is used in the code to create a debounced version of the `search` function, which is then used as an event listener for the `keyup` event on the `searchInput` element. This ensures that the search function is not called too frequently, improving performance and reducing the number of unnecessary search requests.
