This code file contains the Apache License Version 2.0, which is a widely used open-source software license. The purpose of this license is to define the terms and conditions for using, reproducing, and distributing the software and its source code in the Aleo project. The license ensures that the software can be freely used, modified, and shared, while protecting the rights of the original authors and contributors.

The license starts by defining key terms such as "License", "Licensor", "Legal Entity", "You", "Source", "Object", "Work", "Derivative Works", "Contribution", and "Contributor". These definitions are essential for understanding the scope and applicability of the license.

Sections 2 and 3 of the license grant copyright and patent licenses to the users, allowing them to reproduce, prepare derivative works, publicly display, perform, sublicense, and distribute the work in both source and object forms. These licenses are perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and irrevocable, subject to certain conditions.

Section 4 outlines the conditions for redistribution of the work or derivative works, such as providing a copy of the license, stating any changes made, retaining copyright and attribution notices, and including a NOTICE file if applicable.

Section 5 deals with the submission of contributions to the project, stating that any contribution submitted for inclusion in the work shall be under the terms and conditions of the Apache License, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Section 6 clarifies that the license does not grant permission to use the trademarks, service marks, or product names of the licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the work.

Sections 7 and 8 provide disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability, stating that the work is provided on an "AS IS" basis, without any warranties or conditions, and that contributors shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the work.

Section 9 allows users to offer additional support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations while redistributing the work or derivative works, but only on their own behalf and under their sole responsibility.

The appendix provides instructions on how to apply the Apache License to a user's work, including the boilerplate notice to be attached to the work with the appropriate copyright information.

In summary, this code file contains the Apache License that governs the use, modification, and distribution of the Aleo project's software and source code, ensuring that it remains open-source and freely available while protecting the rights of the original authors and contributors.
