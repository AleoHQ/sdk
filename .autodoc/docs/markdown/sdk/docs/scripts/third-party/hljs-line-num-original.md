This code is a part of the `aleo` project and provides line numbering functionality for code blocks highlighted using the `highlight.js` library. It adds line numbers to the code blocks and ensures consistent copy/paste behavior across all browsers.

The code starts by checking if `highlight.js` is available and then adds the necessary functions to the `hljs` object. It also adds the required CSS styles for line numbering.

The `initLineNumbersOnLoad` function initializes line numbering for all code blocks on the page when the document is ready. It processes each code block and adds line numbers if the plugin is not disabled for that block.

The `lineNumbersBlock` and `lineNumbersValue` functions are used to add line numbers to a given code block element or a string value, respectively. They both internally call the `lineNumbersInternal` function, which processes the code block, duplicates multiline nodes if necessary, and adds line numbers using the `addLineNumbersBlockFor` function.

The `addLineNumbersBlockFor` function generates an HTML table with line numbers and code lines as table rows. It also handles the options for starting line numbers and displaying line numbers for single-line code blocks.

The code also includes helper functions for handling options, duplicating multiline nodes, and getting line count. Additionally, it has a `copy` event listener to ensure consistent copy/paste behavior across all browsers, including a workaround for Microsoft Edge.

Here's an example of how to use this code in an HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/highlight.js/styles/default.css">
  <script src="path/to/highlight.js"></script>
  <script src="path/to/this-file.js"></script>
  <script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); hljs.initLineNumbersOnLoad();</script>
</head>
<body>
  <pre><code class="hljs" data-ln-start-from="10">Your code here</code></pre>
</body>
</html>
```

This will initialize the `highlight.js` library and the line numbering plugin, adding line numbers to the code block starting from line 10.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**

   This code is a plugin for the highlight.js library that adds line numbers to the highlighted code blocks. It handles various edge cases and ensures consistent copy/paste behavior across all browsers.

2. **How does the plugin handle line numbering for multiline elements in the code block?**

   The plugin uses the `duplicateMultilineNodes` function to perform a deep traversal of child nodes and calls the `duplicateMultilineNode` function on each node to fix multi-line elements implementation in highlight.js. It wraps each line in a `<span>` element with the same class as the original element and adds a line break after each line.

3. **How can I disable the plugin for a specific code block?**

   To disable the plugin for a specific code block, add the `nohljsln` class to the code block element. The `isPluginDisabledForBlock` function checks if the element has this class and skips line numbering for that block if the class is present.
