This code is a part of the Aleo project and provides line numbering functionality for code blocks that are highlighted using the `highlight.js` library. The code is written as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to avoid polluting the global namespace.

The main purpose of this code is to add line numbers to code blocks that are highlighted using `highlight.js`. It does this by modifying the HTML structure of the code blocks and adding additional elements for line numbers. The code also handles the copy event to ensure that the line numbers are not copied when a user selects and copies the code.

The code provides the following functions:

1. `hljs.initLineNumbersOnLoad(options)`: Initializes the line numbering functionality on page load. It takes an optional `options` object as a parameter.
2. `hljs.lineNumbersBlock(element, options)`: Adds line numbers to a specific code block. It takes an `element` and an optional `options` object as parameters.
3. `hljs.lineNumbersValue(value, options)`: Returns the HTML string with line numbers for a given code string. It takes a `value` and an optional `options` object as parameters.

Example usage:

```javascript
// Initialize line numbering on page load
hljs.initLineNumbersOnLoad();

// Add line numbers to a specific code block
var codeBlock = document.querySelector("code.hljs");
hljs.lineNumbersBlock(codeBlock);

// Get the HTML string with line numbers for a given code string
var codeString = "function hello() {\n  console.log('Hello, world!');\n}";
var numberedCode = hljs.lineNumbersValue(codeString);
```

The code also includes utility functions for string manipulation, splitting text by line, and counting the number of lines in a string. Additionally, it handles the copy event to ensure that the line numbers are not copied when a user selects and copies the code.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of this code?
   **Answer**: This code is a minified JavaScript file that appears to be related to adding line numbers to code blocks formatted with the `highlight.js` library.

2. **Question**: How does this code integrate with `highlight.js`?
   **Answer**: This code extends the `highlight.js` library by adding functions like `initLineNumbersOnLoad`, `lineNumbersBlock`, and `lineNumbersValue` to the `hljs` object.

3. **Question**: How can I customize the line numbering behavior?
   **Answer**: You can customize the line numbering behavior by passing an options object to the `initLineNumbersOnLoad` function, which can include properties like `singleLine` and `startFrom`.
