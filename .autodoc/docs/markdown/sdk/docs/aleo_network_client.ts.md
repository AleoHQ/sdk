This code defines a class `AleoNetworkClient` that manages connections and REST calls to publicly exposed endpoints of Aleo nodes. The class provides methods to interact with the Aleo Blockchain, such as fetching blocks, transactions, and other related information.

The `AleoNetworkClient` constructor takes a `host` parameter, which is the base URL of the Aleo node to connect to. The class also has methods to set and get an `Account` object, which represents an Aleo account.

Some of the key methods in this class include:

- `getBlock(height: number)`: Fetches the block contents of the block at the specified block height.
- `getBlockRange(start: number, end: number)`: Fetches a range of blocks between the specified block heights.
- `getProgram(programId: string)`: Fetches the source code of a program.
- `getLatestBlock()`: Fetches the block contents of the latest block.
- `getTransaction(id: string)`: Fetches a transaction by its unique identifier.
- `getTransactions(height: number)`: Fetches the transactions present at the specified block height.
- `getTransactionsInMempool()`: Fetches the transactions in the memory pool.
- `findUnspentRecords(...)`: Attempts to find unspent records in the Aleo blockchain for a specified private key.

Here's an example of how to use the `AleoNetworkClient` class:

```javascript
// Connection to a local node
let local_connection = new AleoNetworkClient("http://localhost:3030");

// Connection to a public beacon node
let public_connection = new AleoNetworkClient("https://vm.aleo.org/api");

// Set an account
let account = new Account();
connection.setAccount(account);

// Get the latest block
let latestBlock = connection.getLatestBlock();
```

This class can be used in the larger Aleo project to interact with the Aleo Blockchain, fetch information, and perform various operations related to accounts, blocks, and transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `AleoNetworkClient` class?**

   The `AleoNetworkClient` class is a connection management class that encapsulates REST calls to publicly exposed endpoints of Aleo nodes. The methods provided in this class provide information on the Aleo Blockchain.

2. **How can I set an account for the `AleoNetworkClient` instance?**

   You can set an account for the `AleoNetworkClient` instance by calling the `setAccount(account: Account)` method and passing an `Account` object as an argument.

3. **How can I fetch the latest block height using the `AleoNetworkClient` class?**

   You can fetch the latest block height by calling the `getLatestHeight()` method on an instance of the `AleoNetworkClient` class. This method returns a Promise that resolves to the latest block height or an Error if there is an issue fetching the data.
