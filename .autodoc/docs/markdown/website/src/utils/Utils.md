The `aleo` project contains a utility function called `stringToUint8Array` that is responsible for converting a given string into a Uint8Array. Uint8Array is a typed array that represents an array of 8-bit unsigned integers. This function can be useful in various scenarios where you need to work with binary data, such as when dealing with cryptographic operations, file manipulation, or network communication.

The `stringToUint8Array` function takes a single argument, `str`, which is the input string that needs to be converted. It initializes an empty array called `arr` to store the hexadecimal values of each character in the input string.

The function then iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop. Inside the loop, it retrieves the Unicode value of the current character using the `charCodeAt()` method and converts it to a hexadecimal value using the `toString(16)` method. This hexadecimal value is then pushed into the `arr` array.

After processing all the characters in the input string, the function creates a new Uint8Array using the `arr` array and returns it as the final output.

Here's an example of how to use the `stringToUint8Array` function:

```javascript
import { stringToUint8Array } from 'aleo';

const inputString = 'Hello, World!';
const uint8Array = stringToUint8Array(inputString);

console.log(uint8Array);
// Output: Uint8Array(13) [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33]
```

In this example, the `stringToUint8Array` function is imported from the `aleo` project, and it's used to convert the input string 'Hello, World!' into a Uint8Array. The resulting Uint8Array is then logged to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `stringToUint8Array` function?**

   The `stringToUint8Array` function converts a given string into a Uint8Array, where each character in the string is represented by its hexadecimal value.

2. **How does the function handle non-ASCII characters?**

   The function uses the `charCodeAt()` method, which returns the Unicode value of the character at the specified index. This means that non-ASCII characters will be represented by their Unicode values in the resulting Uint8Array.

3. **Is there any error handling or input validation in the function?**

   There is no explicit error handling or input validation in the function. It assumes that the input is a valid string and does not check for edge cases or invalid input types.
