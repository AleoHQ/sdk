The `NewAccount` component in this code is responsible for generating a new account for the Aleo project. It uses React Hooks to manage the state and the Aleo WebAssembly (WASM) library to generate the account details.

The component has three main states: `account`, `loading`, and `aleo`. The `account` state holds the generated account object, while the `loading` state indicates whether the account generation is in progress. The `aleo` state is initialized using the custom `useAleoWASM` hook, which loads the Aleo WASM library.

The `generateAccount` function is responsible for generating a new account. It sets the `loading` state to `true` and then asynchronously creates a new `PrivateKey` object using the Aleo WASM library. After the account is generated, the `account` state is updated, and the `loading` state is set back to `false`.

The `clear` function sets the `account` state to `null`, effectively clearing the generated account details.

The component renders a card with a "Generate" button and a "Clear" button. When the "Generate" button is clicked, the `generateAccount` function is called. If an account has been generated, the component displays a form with the account details: Private Key, View Key, and Address. Each detail is displayed in a disabled input field, along with a "Copy" button to copy the value to the clipboard.

Here's an example of the rendered component:

```jsx
<Card title="Create a New Account" style={{width: "100%", borderRadius: "20px"}} bordered={false}>
    <Row justify="center">
        <Col><Button type="primary" shape="round" size="large" onClick={generateAccount}
                     loading={!!loading}>Generate</Button></Col>
        <Col offset="1"><Button shape="round" size="large" onClick={clear}>Clear</Button></Col>
    </Row>
    {
        account &&
            <Form {...layout}>
                <Divider/>
                <Form.Item label="Private Key" colon={false}>
                    <Input size="large" placeholder="Private Key" value={privateKey()}
                           addonAfter={<CopyButton data={privateKey()}/>} disabled/>
                </Form.Item>
                <Form.Item label="View Key" colon={false}>
                    <Input size="large" placeholder="View Key" value={viewKey()}
                           addonAfter={<CopyButton data={viewKey()}/>} disabled/>
                </Form.Item>
                <Form.Item label="Address" colon={false}>
                    <Input size="large" placeholder="Address" value={address()}
                           addonAfter={<CopyButton data={address()}/>} disabled/>
                </Form.Item>
            </Form>
    }
</Card>
```

In the larger project, this component can be used to create new accounts for users, allowing them to interact with the Aleo platform.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `useAleoWASM` hook and where is it defined?
   **Answer**: The `useAleoWASM` hook is used to interact with the Aleo WASM library. It is likely defined in the `aleo-wasm-hook` file, which is imported at the beginning of the code.

2. **Question**: How does the `generateAccount` function work and why is there a `setTimeout` with a 25ms delay?
   **Answer**: The `generateAccount` function is an asynchronous function that generates a new Aleo account by creating a new private key using the Aleo WASM library. The `setTimeout` with a 25ms delay is used to simulate a loading state, giving the impression that the account generation process takes some time.

3. **Question**: What are the `privateKey`, `viewKey`, and `address` functions used for, and how are they related to the `account` state?
   **Answer**: The `privateKey`, `viewKey`, and `address` functions are used to extract the respective values from the `account` state. They return the string representation of the private key, view key, and address of the account if the account is not null, otherwise, they return an empty string.
