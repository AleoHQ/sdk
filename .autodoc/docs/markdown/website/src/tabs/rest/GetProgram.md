The `GetProgram` component in this code is a React functional component that allows users to search for a program by its ID and display its bytecode. It uses the `antd` library for the UI components and `axios` for making API requests.

The component maintains three state variables: `program`, `programID`, and `status`. `program` stores the bytecode of the fetched program, `programID` stores the user input for the program ID, and `status` stores the validation status of the input field.

The `onChange` function updates the `programID` state when the user types in the input field or clicks the "Demo" button. The `onSearch` function is called when the user submits the search, which in turn calls the `tryRequest` function.

The `tryRequest` function makes an API request to `https://vm.aleo.org/api/testnet3/program/${id}` using `axios`. If the request is successful, it sets the `status` to "success" and updates the `program` state with the fetched bytecode. If the request fails, it sets the `status` to "error" and resets the `program` state to `null`.

The component renders a `Card` containing a `Form` with an input field for the program ID. When a valid program ID is entered and the program bytecode is fetched, the bytecode is displayed in a `TextArea` component. A `CopyButton` component is provided to copy the bytecode to the clipboard.

Here's an example of how the `GetProgram` component might be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { GetProgram } from './aleo';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Search for a Program</h1>
      <GetProgram />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `GetProgram` component is imported and used in the `App` component, allowing users to search for programs by their IDs and view their bytecodes.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `tryRequest` function and how does it handle errors?
   **Answer:** The `tryRequest` function is responsible for making an API request to fetch the program bytecode with the given program id. It handles errors by catching them and setting the program state to `null`, status state to `"error"`, and logging the error to the console.

2. **Question:** How does the `onChange` function work and what is its role in the component?
   **Answer:** The `onChange` function is triggered when the user changes the input value in the search bar or clicks the "Demo" button. It updates the `programID` state with the new input value and returns the updated `programID`.

3. **Question:** How is the `CopyButton` component used in this code and what data does it receive?
   **Answer:** The `CopyButton` component is used to copy the program bytecode to the clipboard. It receives the `programString()` as its data, which is the program bytecode fetched from the API.
