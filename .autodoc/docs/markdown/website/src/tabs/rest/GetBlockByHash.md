The `GetBlockByHash` component in this code is a React component that allows users to search for a specific block in the Aleo blockchain by its hash. It uses the Ant Design library for UI components and Axios for making API requests.

When the user enters a block hash in the search bar and submits the search, the `onSearch` function is called, which in turn calls the `tryRequest` function. The `tryRequest` function sends an API request to the Aleo VM server at `https://vm.aleo.org/api/testnet3/block/${hash}` to fetch the block data corresponding to the given hash.

If the API request is successful, the response data is stored in the `blockByHash` state variable as a formatted JSON string, and the `status` state variable is set to "success". If there's an error, the `status` state variable is set to "error", and the error is logged to the console.

The component renders a card with a search bar for the user to input the block hash. If the `blockByHash` state variable is not null, meaning a block has been fetched, the component renders a form with a read-only text area displaying the block data and a copy button to copy the block data to the clipboard.

Here's an example of how the `GetBlockByHash` component might be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { GetBlockByHash } from './aleo/GetBlockByHash';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Aleo Blockchain Explorer</h1>
      <GetBlockByHash />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `GetBlockByHash` component is used in the main `App` component to allow users to search for blocks in the Aleo blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `tryRequest` function and how does it handle errors?
   **Answer**: The `tryRequest` function is responsible for making an API request to the Aleo server to fetch a block by its hash. It handles errors by catching them and setting the `status` state to "error" while also logging the error to the console.

2. **Question**: How does the `onSearch` function work and when is it called?
   **Answer**: The `onSearch` function is called when the user enters a value in the search bar and presses enter or clicks the search button. It calls the `tryRequest` function with the entered value as its argument.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `blockString` function and how is it used in the component?
   **Answer**: The `blockString` function is used to convert the `blockByHash` state value to a string. It is used in the `value` prop of the `Input.TextArea` component to display the fetched block data and in the `data` prop of the `CopyButton` component to provide the data to be copied.
