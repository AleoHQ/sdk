The `GetBlockByHeight` component in this code is a React component that allows users to search for a specific block in the Aleo blockchain by its height. It uses the `antd` library for UI components and `axios` for making API requests.

When the user enters a block height in the search bar and submits the search, the `onSearch` function is called, which in turn calls the `tryRequest` function with the entered height value. The `tryRequest` function sets the `blockByHeight` state to `null` and makes an API request to `https://vm.aleo.org/api/testnet3/block/${height}` using `axios`. If the request is successful, the response data is stored in the `blockByHeight` state as a formatted JSON string, and the `status` state is set to `"success"`. If there's an error, the `status` state is set to `"error"`.

The component renders a `Card` containing a `Form` with an `Input.Search` field for the user to enter the block height. When the `blockByHeight` state is not `null`, it also renders a `Divider`, a `Row` containing a `Form.Item` with an `Input.TextArea` displaying the block data, and a `CopyButton` component to copy the block data to the clipboard.

Here's an example of how the `GetBlockByHeight` component might be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { GetBlockByHeight } from './aleo/GetBlockByHeight';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Aleo Blockchain Explorer</h1>
      <GetBlockByHeight />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `GetBlockByHeight` component is included in the main `App` component, allowing users to search for blocks by height in the Aleo blockchain explorer.
