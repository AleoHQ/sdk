This code is an HTML template for the Aleo SDK, a Software Development Kit for Zero-Knowledge Transactions. The template serves as the foundation for the web application's user interface and provides essential metadata for web app installation on mobile devices or desktops.

The `<head>` section contains metadata and links to external resources. The `<meta>` tags define the character set, viewport settings, theme color, and a description of the SDK. The `<link>` tags reference the favicon, apple-touch-icon, and the web app manifest file, which contains additional metadata for app installation. The `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholder is used to reference files in the `public` folder during the build process, ensuring correct paths for client-side routing and non-root public URLs.

The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web application to "Aleo SDK". The `<body>` section contains a `<noscript>` tag, which displays a message to users if JavaScript is disabled in their browser, as the app requires JavaScript to function properly. The `<div id="root"></div>` serves as the mounting point for the React application, where the bundled scripts will be injected during the build process.

This HTML template is designed to be used in conjunction with a build tool like npm or yarn. Developers can run `npm start` or `yarn start` to begin development, and `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create a production bundle. The build step will replace the `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholder with the actual URL of the `public` folder and inject the bundled scripts into the `<body>` tag.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholder in the code, and how is it replaced during the build process?
   **Answer:** The `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholder is used to reference files inside the `public` folder from the HTML. It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build process, ensuring that the correct path is used for both client-side routing and a non-root public URL.

2. **Question:** How can a developer configure a non-root public URL for this project?
   **Answer:** A developer can configure a non-root public URL by running the `npm run build` command. This will ensure that the `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholder is replaced with the correct path for a non-root public URL.

3. **Question:** How can a developer add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this HTML file, and what happens to these additions during the build process?
   **Answer:** A developer can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics directly to this HTML file. During the build process, the bundled scripts will be placed into the `<body>` tag, and any additions made to the HTML file will be preserved and included in the final output.
