The code provided is part of the Aleo Development Server, a tool designed to help developers build and deploy Aleo programs. The server is responsible for performing proving and verification operations required for deploying and executing Aleo programs. Once these operations are completed, the resulting deployments or executions are broadcasted to the Aleo Network. The server receives necessary information from the user via a REST API, allowing developers to use any language of their choice to send RESTful requests.

The `CLI` struct is the main entry point for the command-line interface, with a single field `command` of type `Command`. The `Command` enum has a single variant, `Start`, which represents the command to start the development server. The `Start` variant has four optional fields: `key_ciphertext`, `server_address`, `peer`, and `debug`.

- `key_ciphertext`: An optional private key ciphertext to start the server with. If provided, the server will store it in memory and look for an optional `password` field in the JSON body of incoming requests.
- `server_address`: The URI and port the development server will listen on, with a default value of `0.0.0.0:4040`.
- `peer`: The Aleo Network peer URI to connect to, with a default value of `https://vm.aleo.org/api`. The development server will send completed deploy and execute transactions to this peer.
- `debug`: A flag to start the server with debug logging enabled, defaulting to `false`.

The `Command` enum also has a `parse` method, which initializes the `Rest` struct based on the provided command. In the case of the `Start` command, it calls `Rest::initialize` with the provided `server_address`, `key_ciphertext`, `peer`, and `debug` values.

Example usage:

```sh
aleo-develop start --key-ciphertext <ciphertext> --server-address 0.0.0.0:4040 --peer https://vm.aleo.org/api --debug
```

This code is essential for setting up and configuring the Aleo Development Server, allowing developers to easily interact with the Aleo Network and deploy their programs.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the Aleo Development Server?**

   The Aleo Development Server is a tool to help developers build and deploy Aleo programs. It is built in Rust and performs the proving and verification operations required to deploy and execute Aleo programs. The server receives the information necessary to deploy and execute programs from the user via a REST API.

2. **How does the server handle private keys and encryption?**

   The server can be started with an optional `private key ciphertext`. If provided, the server will store this ciphertext in memory and look for an optional `password` field in the JSON body of the deploy, execute, and transfer requests it receives. If the `password` field is found in a request, it will attempt to use it to decrypt the `private key ciphertext` into a `private key` and use the `private key` to create program deployment and execution transactions on the Aleo Network.

3. **How does the server connect to the Aleo Network?**

   The server connects to the Aleo Network through a specified peer URI. The development server will send its completed deploy and execute transactions to this peer. The peer must be running the testnet3 API in order for the development server to successfully send transactions to the Aleo Network.
