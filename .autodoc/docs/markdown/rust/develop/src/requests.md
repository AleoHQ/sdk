This code defines three request structures for the Aleo project, which are used to interact with the Aleo network. These structures are serialized and deserialized using the Serde library, allowing them to be easily sent and received over the network. The three request structures are:

1. `DeployRequest`: This structure is used to deploy a new program on the Aleo network. It contains the following fields:
    - `program`: The program to be deployed.
    - `private_key`: An optional private key for signing the deployment request.
    - `password`: An optional password for unlocking the private key.
    - `fee`: The fee to be paid for deploying the program.
    - `fee_record`: An optional record for the fee payment.
    - `peer_url`: An optional URL of a peer to send the request to.

   Example usage:
   ```
   let deploy_request = DeployRequest {
       program: my_program,
       private_key: Some(my_private_key),
       password: Some("my_password"),
       fee: 100,
       fee_record: Some(my_fee_record),
       peer_url: Some("http://my_peer_url.com"),
   };
   ```

2. `ExecuteRequest`: This structure is used to execute a program on the Aleo network. It contains the following fields:
    - `program_id`: The ID of the program to be executed.
    - `program_function`: The function to be executed within the program.
    - `inputs`: A vector of input values for the function.
    - `private_key`: An optional private key for signing the execution request.
    - `password`: An optional password for unlocking the private key.
    - `fee`: The fee to be paid for executing the program.
    - `fee_record`: An optional record for the fee payment.
    - `peer_url`: An optional URL of a peer to send the request to.

   Example usage:
   ```
   let execute_request = ExecuteRequest {
       program_id: my_program_id,
       program_function: my_function,
       inputs: vec!["input1", "input2"],
       private_key: Some(my_private_key),
       password: Some("my_password"),
       fee: 50,
       fee_record: Some(my_fee_record),
       peer_url: Some("http://my_peer_url.com"),
   };
   ```

3. `TransferRequest`: This structure is used to make a transfer of Aleo credits between addresses on the Aleo network. It contains the following fields:
    - `amount`: The amount of Aleo credits to be transferred.
    - `fee`: The fee to be paid for the transfer.
    - `recipient`: The recipient's address.
    - `private_key`: An optional private key for signing the transfer request.
    - `password`: An optional password for unlocking the private key.
    - `fee_record`: An optional record for the fee payment.
    - `amount_record`: An optional record for the amount to be transferred.
    - `peer_url`: An optional URL of a peer to send the request to.

   Example usage:
   ```
   let transfer_request = TransferRequest {
       amount: 1000,
       fee: 10,
       recipient: my_recipient_address,
       private_key: Some(my_private_key),
       password: Some("my_password"),
       fee_record: Some(my_fee_record),
       amount_record: Some(my_amount_record),
       peer_url: Some("http://my_peer_url.com"),
   };
   ```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `DeployRequest`, `ExecuteRequest`, and `TransferRequest` structs?
   **Answer:** These structs represent different types of requests in the Aleo project. `DeployRequest` is for deploying a new program, `ExecuteRequest` is for executing a program, and `TransferRequest` is for making a transfer of Aleo credits.

2. **Question:** What is the role of the `Network` trait in these structs?
   **Answer:** The `Network` trait is used as a generic type parameter in these structs, allowing them to work with different network implementations. This makes the code more flexible and adaptable to various network configurations.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `password` field in these structs?
   **Answer:** The `password` field is an optional field that can be used to provide additional security when making requests. It can be used to authenticate the user or protect sensitive information, such as private keys.
