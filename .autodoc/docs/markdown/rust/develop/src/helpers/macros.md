This code snippet is part of the Aleo library and provides a macro called `spawn_blocking`. The purpose of this macro is to spawn a blocking Tokio task and await its result. This is particularly useful for performing computationally intensive tasks, such as proof computation, without blocking the main execution thread.

Tokio is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language, which allows developers to write concurrent and non-blocking code. However, some tasks may require blocking operations, such as file I/O or CPU-bound computations. In such cases, it is essential to offload these tasks to a separate thread to prevent blocking the main execution thread.

The `spawn_blocking` macro takes a closure as input, which represents the blocking task to be executed. It then uses the `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` function to spawn a new blocking task with the provided closure. The `move` keyword is used to capture the variables used in the closure by value, ensuring that the closure has ownership of these variables.

Once the blocking task is spawned, the macro awaits its result using the `.await` keyword. The `or_reject()` function is called on both the spawned task and the awaited result to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the task. If an error occurs, the macro will return an error, otherwise, it will return the result of the blocking task.

Here's an example of how the `spawn_blocking` macro can be used in the Aleo project:

```rust
async fn compute_proof() -> Result<Proof, Error> {
    let result = spawn_blocking! {
        // Perform some computationally intensive task
        compute_proof_blocking()
    };

    Ok(result)
}
```

In this example, the `compute_proof` function uses the `spawn_blocking` macro to offload the `compute_proof_blocking` function to a separate thread. This allows the main execution thread to continue processing other tasks while the proof computation is being performed.
## Questions:
