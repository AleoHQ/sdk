The `Encryptor` struct in this code provides functionality for encrypting and decrypting Aleo key material, specifically private keys, using a secret. This is useful in the larger project for securely storing and retrieving private keys, which are essential for signing transactions and other cryptographic operations.

The `Encryptor` struct has two main public methods: `encrypt_private_key_with_secret` and `decrypt_private_key_with_secret`. These methods take a private key and a secret as input, and return an encrypted private key (ciphertext) or a decrypted private key, respectively.

Internally, the `Encryptor` uses two private helper methods: `encrypt_field` and `decrypt_field`. These methods handle the actual encryption and decryption of field elements, which are the building blocks of private keys. The encryption process involves deriving domain separators and a secret, generating a nonce, deriving a blinding factor, and creating an encryption target. The decryption process involves recovering the field element encrypted within the ciphertext.

The code also includes a set of tests to ensure the functionality of the `Encryptor`. These tests cover various scenarios, such as encrypting and decrypting the same private key with the same secret, using different secrets, and using different private keys. The tests help ensure that the `Encryptor` works as expected and that the encrypted private keys can be successfully decrypted with the correct secret.

Example usage:

```rust
let private_key = PrivateKey::<CurrentNetwork>::new(&mut rng).unwrap();
let encrypted_key = Encryptor::<CurrentNetwork>::encrypt_private_key_with_secret(&private_key, "mypassword").unwrap();
let decrypted_key = Encryptor::<CurrentNetwork>::decrypt_private_key_with_secret(&encrypted_key, "mypassword").unwrap();
assert_eq!(private_key, decrypted_key);
```

In this example, a private key is encrypted with the secret "mypassword" and then decrypted using the same secret. The original private key and the decrypted private key should be equal.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Encryptor` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `Encryptor` struct is a tool for encrypting and decrypting Aleo key material into ciphertext. It provides methods to encrypt and decrypt private keys using a secret, as well as helper functions for encrypting and decrypting field elements.

2. **Question**: How does the encryption and decryption process work in this implementation?
   **Answer**: The encryption process involves deriving domain separators and a secret, generating a nonce, deriving a blinding factor, and creating an encryption target. The decryption process involves deriving domain separators and a secret, decrypting the ciphertext, and recovering the field element by dividing the recovered key by the recovered blinding factor.

3. **Question**: What are the test cases provided for this implementation and what do they test?
   **Answer**: The test cases provided test the following scenarios: (1) Encrypting and decrypting a private key, (2) Ensuring that a wrong password doesn't decrypt the private key, (3) Ensuring that the same secret doesn't produce the same ciphertext on different runs, (4) Ensuring that private keys encrypted with different passwords match, and (5) Ensuring that different private keys encrypted with the same password don't match.
