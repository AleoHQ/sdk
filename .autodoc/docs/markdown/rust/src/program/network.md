This code is part of the Aleo project and defines the `ProgramManager` struct implementation for managing Aleo programs on the Aleo network. The `ProgramManager` struct is generic over a network type `N` that implements the `Network` trait.

The `broadcast_transaction` method is used to broadcast a transaction to the Aleo network. It takes a `Transaction<N>` as input and returns a `Result<String>`. The method first determines the transaction type (either "Deployment" or "Execute") and then uses the configured API client to broadcast the transaction. If the broadcast is successful, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints an error message.

The `api_client` method returns a reference to the configured `AleoAPIClient<N>` instance. It returns an error if no API client is found.

The `on_chain_program_state` method checks the on-chain version of a program to determine if it is deployed and if it is the same as the local version. It takes a reference to a `Program<N>` and returns a `Result<OnChainProgramState>`. The method first gets the program ID and then uses the API client to fetch the on-chain program. It then compares the on-chain program with the local program and returns the appropriate `OnChainProgramState` variant.

The code also includes a test module that tests the functionality of the `ProgramManager` implementation. The tests cover the following scenarios:

1. The API client works as expected.
2. The `on_chain_program_state` method correctly identifies when a program is deployed and matches the local version.
3. The `on_chain_program_state` method correctly identifies when a program is not deployed.
4. The `on_chain_program_state` method correctly identifies when a program is deployed but different from the local version.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `broadcast_transaction` function?
   **Answer**: The `broadcast_transaction` function is responsible for broadcasting a transaction (either a deployment or execution transaction) to the Aleo network using the configured API client.

2. **Question**: How does the `on_chain_program_state` function determine the state of a program on the chain?
   **Answer**: The `on_chain_program_state` function queries the Aleo API client for the program with the given ID. If the program is found on the chain, it compares the on-chain program with the local program to determine if they are the same or different. If the program is not found on the chain, it returns `NotDeployed`.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `test_network_functionality_works_as_expected` test function?
   **Answer**: The `test_network_functionality_works_as_expected` test function checks various aspects of the `ProgramManager` implementation, such as the API client functionality, the ability to determine the on-chain program state, and the handling of deployed and non-deployed programs.
