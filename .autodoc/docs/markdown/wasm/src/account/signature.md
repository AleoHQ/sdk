This code provides a `Signature` struct and its associated methods for signing and verifying messages in the Aleo project. The `Signature` struct is a wrapper around the `SignatureNative` type, which is the actual signature implementation. The purpose of this wrapper is to provide a WebAssembly-compatible interface for the underlying signature functionality.

The `Signature` struct provides the following methods:

- `sign`: This method takes a `PrivateKey` and a message (byte array) as input, and returns a `Signature` instance. It uses the `SignatureNative::sign_bytes` method to sign the message with the given private key, using a random number generator (`StdRng::from_entropy()`).

  Example usage:
  ```
  let private_key = PrivateKey::new();
  let message: [u8; 32] = [1, 2, 3, ...];
  let signature = Signature::sign(&private_key, &message);
  ```

- `verify`: This method takes an `Address` and a message (byte array) as input, and returns a boolean indicating whether the signature is valid for the given address and message. It uses the `SignatureNative::verify_bytes` method for verification.

  Example usage:
  ```
  let address = private_key.to_address();
  let is_valid = signature.verify(&address, &message);
  ```

- `from_string` and `to_string`: These methods allow converting a `Signature` instance to and from a string representation. They use the `FromStr` and `Display` implementations of `SignatureNative`.

  Example usage:
  ```
  let signature_str = signature.to_string();
  let signature_from_str = Signature::from_string(&signature_str);
  ```

The code also includes a test module that checks the `sign` and `verify` methods for correctness. The test generates random private keys and messages, signs the messages, and verifies the signatures. It also checks that the signatures are invalid for different messages.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Signature` struct and its associated methods in this code?
   **Answer:** The `Signature` struct is a wrapper around the `SignatureNative` type, providing methods for signing a message with a private key, verifying a signature with an address and message, and converting the signature to and from a string representation.

2. **Question:** How does the `sign` method work and what kind of random number generator is used?
   **Answer:** The `sign` method takes a reference to a `PrivateKey` and a byte slice representing the message to be signed. It uses the `SignatureNative::sign_bytes` method to sign the message, and the random number generator used is `StdRng` seeded with entropy.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `test_sign_and_verify` function in the `tests` module?
   **Answer:** The `test_sign_and_verify` function is a test function that checks whether the `sign` and `verify` methods of the `Signature` struct work correctly. It generates random private keys and messages, signs the messages, and verifies the signatures for a specified number of iterations (1,000 in this case).
