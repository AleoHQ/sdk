This code defines a `PrivateKeyCiphertext` struct and its associated methods for encrypting and decrypting private keys using a secret string. The purpose of this code is to provide a secure way to store and manage private keys in the Aleo project.

The `PrivateKeyCiphertext` struct contains a `CiphertextNative` object, which represents the encrypted private key. The struct provides the following methods:

- `encrypt_private_key`: Encrypts a given private key using a secret string. The secret string is sensitive and should be stored securely, as it will be needed to decrypt the private key later.
  ```rust
  let private_key = PrivateKey::new();
  let private_key_ciphertext = PrivateKeyCiphertext::encrypt_private_key(&private_key, "mypassword").unwrap();
  ```

- `decrypt_to_private_key`: Decrypts the private key ciphertext using a secret string. The secret string must be the same as the one used to encrypt the private key.
  ```rust
  let recovered_private_key = private_key_ciphertext.decrypt_to_private_key("mypassword").unwrap();
  ```

- `to_string` and `from_string`: These methods allow converting the `PrivateKeyCiphertext` object to a string representation and creating a `PrivateKeyCiphertext` object from a string representation, respectively.
  ```rust
  let ciphertext_string = private_key_ciphertext.to_string();
  let private_key_ciphertext_from_string = PrivateKeyCiphertext::from_string(ciphertext_string).unwrap();
  ```

The code also includes tests to ensure the functionality of the `PrivateKeyCiphertext` struct and its methods, such as encryption and decryption, string conversion, and edge cases handling.

In the larger Aleo project, this code can be used to securely store and manage private keys, ensuring that they are encrypted and can only be accessed with the correct secret string.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PrivateKeyCiphertext` struct and how is it used in the Aleo project?
   **Answer**: The `PrivateKeyCiphertext` struct represents an encrypted private key. It provides methods to encrypt a private key using a secret string and to decrypt it back using the same secret string. This is useful for securely storing private keys in the Aleo project.

2. **Question**: How does the `encrypt_private_key` function work and what are the possible error scenarios?
   **Answer**: The `encrypt_private_key` function takes a reference to a `PrivateKey` and a secret string, and returns a `Result` containing a `PrivateKeyCiphertext` or an error message. It uses the `Encryptor::encrypt_private_key_with_secret` function to perform the encryption. Possible error scenarios include encryption failure, which results in an "Encryption failed" error message.

3. **Question**: How does the `decrypt_to_private_key` function work and what are the possible error scenarios?
   **Answer**: The `decrypt_to_private_key` function takes a reference to a `PrivateKeyCiphertext` and a secret string, and returns a `Result` containing a `PrivateKey` or an error message. It uses the `Encryptor::decrypt_private_key_with_secret` function to perform the decryption. Possible error scenarios include decryption failure, which results in a "Decryption failed - ciphertext was not a private key" error message.
