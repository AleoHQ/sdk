This code defines the `Address` struct and its associated methods for the Aleo project. The `Address` struct is a wrapper around the `AddressNative` type, which represents an Aleo account address. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to create and manipulate Aleo addresses, as well as to verify signatures for messages associated with these addresses.

The `Address` struct provides the following methods:

- `from_private_key`: Creates an `Address` instance from a given `PrivateKey`. This is useful for deriving an address from a user's private key.
  ```rust
  let private_key = PrivateKey::new();
  let address = Address::from_private_key(&private_key);
  ```

- `from_view_key`: Creates an `Address` instance from a given `ViewKey`. This is useful for deriving an address from a user's view key.
  ```rust
  let view_key = private_key.to_view_key();
  let address = Address::from_view_key(&view_key);
  ```

- `from_string`: Creates an `Address` instance from a given string representation of an address. This is useful for parsing addresses from user input or configuration files.
  ```rust
  let address_str = "aleo1...";
  let address = Address::from_string(address_str);
  ```

- `to_string`: Returns the string representation of an `Address` instance. This is useful for displaying addresses to users or storing them in configuration files.
  ```rust
  let address_str = address.to_string();
  ```

- `verify`: Verifies a given `Signature` for a message associated with an `Address` instance. This is useful for checking the authenticity of messages sent by users.
  ```rust
  let message = b"Hello, world!";
  let signature = private_key.sign(message);
  let is_valid = address.verify(message, &signature);
  ```

Additionally, the code provides implementations for the `FromStr`, `Display`, and `Deref` traits, which allow for convenient conversions between the `Address` and `AddressNative` types, as well as string representations of addresses.

The test module at the end of the code tests the `from_private_key` and `from_view_key` methods, ensuring that they produce the same address for a given private key.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Address` struct and its associated methods in this code?
   **Answer**: The `Address` struct represents an address in the Aleo library. It provides methods to create an address from a private key, a view key, or a string, as well as methods to convert the address to a string and verify a signature against a message.

2. **Question**: How does the `verify` method work in the `Address` implementation?
   **Answer**: The `verify` method takes a message and a signature as input and checks if the signature is valid for the given message and the address instance. It returns a boolean value indicating the validity of the signature.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Deref` implementation for the `Address` struct?
   **Answer**: The `Deref` implementation allows the `Address` struct to be automatically dereferenced to its inner `AddressNative` type when needed. This makes it easier to work with the `Address` struct in contexts where the native type is expected.
