This code defines a `Transaction` struct and its associated methods for the Aleo project. The `Transaction` struct represents an Aleo transaction, which is created when generating an on-chain function deployment or execution. It is the object that should be submitted to the Aleo Network to deploy or execute a function.

The `Transaction` struct has the following methods:

- `from_string`: Creates a `Transaction` instance from a string representation of a transaction. This is useful when receiving a transaction as a string from an external source and needing to convert it into a `Transaction` object.
    ```rust
    let transaction = Transaction::from_string(transaction_string).unwrap();
    ```

- `to_string`: Returns the string representation of the `Transaction` instance. This is useful when needing to submit the transaction to the Aleo Network as a string in the `POST` data.
    ```rust
    let transaction_string = transaction.to_string();
    ```

- `transaction_id`: Returns the transaction ID, which is the Merkle root of the transaction's inclusion proof. This ID can be used to query the status of the transaction on the Aleo Network to see if it was successful.
    ```rust
    let transaction_id = transaction.transaction_id();
    ```

- `transaction_type`: Returns the type of the transaction as a string, either "deploy" or "execute".
    ```rust
    let transaction_type = transaction.transaction_type();
    ```

The code also provides implementations for converting between the `Transaction` struct and its native representation, `TransactionNative`. This is useful for interoperability between the WebAssembly and native Rust code.

Lastly, the code includes a test module that demonstrates how to use the `Transaction` struct and its methods, ensuring the correct functionality of the code.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Transaction` struct and its methods in this code?
   **Answer**: The `Transaction` struct represents an Aleo transaction in WebAssembly. It provides methods to create a transaction from a string, get the transaction as a string, get the transaction ID, and get the transaction type (either "deploy" or "execute").

2. **Question**: How does the code handle the conversion between `Transaction` and `TransactionNative`?
   **Answer**: The code provides `From` trait implementations for converting between `Transaction` and `TransactionNative`. The `From<Transaction>` implementation for `TransactionNative` extracts the inner `TransactionNative` from the `Transaction`, and the `From<TransactionNative>` implementation for `Transaction` wraps the `TransactionNative` in a `Transaction` struct.

3. **Question**: How are errors handled when parsing a transaction from a string?
   **Answer**: Errors are handled using the `Result` type. When parsing a transaction from a string using the `from_str` method, if an error occurs, it returns a `Result` with an `Err` variant containing a `String` describing the error.
