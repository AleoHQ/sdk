The code in this file provides a WebAssembly (WASM) representation of an Aleo program, which is required to create an Execution or Deployment transaction. It includes several convenience methods for enumerating available functions and each function's inputs in a JavaScript object for usage in the creation of web forms for input capture.

The `Program` struct is the main component of this file, and it provides several methods to interact with Aleo programs:

- `from_string(program: &str)`: Creates a `Program` instance from a program string.
- `to_string(&self)`: Returns a string representation of the program.
- `get_functions(&self)`: Returns a JavaScript array of function names in the program.
- `get_function_inputs(&self, function_name: String)`: Returns a JavaScript object representation of the function inputs and types, which can be used to generate a web form to capture user inputs for an execution of a function.
- `get_record_members(&self, record_name: String)`: Returns a JavaScript object representation of a program record and its types.
- `get_struct_members(&self, struct_name: String)`: Returns a JavaScript object representation of a program struct and its types.

Here's an example of how to use the `Program` struct:

```rust
let program_string = ProgramNative::credits().unwrap().to_string();
let program = Program::from_string(&program_string).unwrap();
let functions = program.get_functions();
let function_inputs = program.get_function_inputs("transfer".to_string()).unwrap();
let record_members = program.get_record_members("credits".to_string()).unwrap();
let struct_members = program.get_struct_members("token_metadata".to_string()).unwrap();
```

This code can be used in the larger Aleo project to interact with Aleo programs in a web environment, making it easier to create web forms for input capture and work with Aleo programs in a JavaScript context.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Program` struct and its associated methods in this code?

   **Answer:** The `Program` struct is a WebAssembly representation of an Aleo program. It is required to create an Execution or Deployment transaction and includes several convenience methods for enumerating available functions and each function's inputs in a JavaScript object for usage in the creation of web forms for input capture.

2. **Question:** How does the `get_function_inputs` method work and what does it return?

   **Answer:** The `get_function_inputs` method takes a function name as input and returns a JavaScript array of objects representing the function inputs and their types. This can be used to generate a web form to capture user inputs for an execution of a function.

3. **Question:** How can I get a JavaScript object representation of a program record and its types?

   **Answer:** You can use the `get_record_members` method by providing the record name as input. This method returns a JavaScript object representation of the program record and its types.
