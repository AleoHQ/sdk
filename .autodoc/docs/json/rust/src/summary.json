This is useful in the larger project for securely storing and retrieving private keys, which are essential for signing transactions and other cryptographic operations.\n\nThe `Encryptor` struct has two main public methods: `encrypt_private_key_with_secret` and `decrypt_private_key_with_secret`. These methods take a private key and a secret as input, and return an encrypted private key (ciphertext) or a decrypted private key, respectively.\n\nInternally, the `Encryptor` uses two private helper methods: `encrypt_field` and `decrypt_field`. These methods handle the actual encryption and decryption of field elements, which are the building blocks of private keys. The encryption process involves deriving domain separators and a secret, generating a nonce, deriving a blinding factor, and creating an encryption target. The decryption process involves recovering the field element encrypted within the ciphertext.\n\nThe code also includes a set of tests to ensure the functionality of the `Encryptor`. These tests cover various scenarios, such as encrypting and decrypting the same private key with the same secret, using different secrets, and using different private keys.

If a private key ciphertext is provided, a password must be supplied to decrypt it when calling the `get_private_key` method.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `ProgramManager` handle program addition, update, and retrieval?\n   **Answer**: The `ProgramManager` provides methods like `add_program`, `update_program`, and `get_program` for managing programs. `add_program` adds a program to the manager if it does not already exist, `update_program` adds a program if it does not exist or updates it if it does, and `get_program` retrieves a program from the manager if it exists."

It takes a `Transaction<N>` as input and returns a `Result<String>`. The method first determines the transaction type (either \"Deployment\" or \"Execute\") and then uses the configured API client to broadcast the transaction.
