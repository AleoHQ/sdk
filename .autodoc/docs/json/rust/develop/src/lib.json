  "summary": "The Aleo Development Server is a REST server that provides endpoints for proving and verification operations necessary to create Aleo program deployments/executions and broadcast them to the Aleo network. It is designed for use in trusted contexts like local development environments, CI/CD pipelines, or private cloud networks.\n\nThe server offers three REST endpoints:\n- `/deploy`: Create a program deployment\n- `/execute`: Create a program execution\n- `/transfer`: Create a transfer of Aleo credits\n\nThe server can be installed using `cargo install aleo-develop` and started with `aleo-develop start`. It can be configured with an encrypted private key, which requires a password field in the incoming request body to decrypt the private key.\n\nThe endpoints accept POST requests with a JSON body. A JavaScript client for the server is available in the [Aleo SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aleohq/sdk). The server's API is under active development and may change in the future.\n\nHere's an example of a curl request to deploy a program:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-d '{\n    \"program\": \"program hello.aleo;\\n\\nfunction main:\\n    input r0 as u32.public;\\n    input r1 as u32.private;\\n    add r0 r1 into r2;\\n    output r2 as u32.private;\\n\",\n    \"fee\": 100000,\n    \"private_key\": \"APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH\"\n}' \\\nhttp://0.0.0.0:4040/testnet3/deploy\n```\n\nThe server is initialized with a socket address, private key ciphertext, peer URL, and a debug flag. It uses the AleoAPIClient to communicate with the Aleo network and the RecordFinder to search for suitable records for fees and transfers.",
  "questions": "1. **What are the available REST endpoints and their functionalities?**\n\n   The Aleo Development Server provides three REST endpoints:\n   - `/deploy`: Creates a program deployment.\n   - `/execute`: Creates a program execution.\n   - `/transfer`: Creates a transfer of Aleo credits.\n\n2. **How can the server be started with an encrypted private key?**\n\n   The server can be started with an encrypted private key by using the following command:\n   ```\n   aleo-develop start --key-ciphertext <encrypted_private_key>\n   ```\n   When this option is used, the server will look for a password field in the body of incoming requests to decrypt the private key.\n\n3. **Is there a JavaScript client for this server?**\n\n   Yes, a JavaScript client for this server is available in the [Aleo SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aleohq/sdk)."
