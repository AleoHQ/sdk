  "summary": "This code defines the structure and functionality of a web page that documents the `DevelopmentClient` class in the Aleo project. The `DevelopmentClient` class is used to interact with an Aleo Development Server.\n\nThe web page is structured with a sidebar containing navigation links to other classes in the project, a top navigation bar with search functionality, and a main content area displaying the details of the `DevelopmentClient` class.\n\nThe `DevelopmentClient` class has a constructor that takes a single parameter, `baseURL`, which is the URL of the Aleo Development Server. The constructor is documented with a description, parameter details, and source file information.\n\nThe web page also includes various JavaScript and CSS files to handle interactivity, styling, and search functionality. The `tocbot` library is used to generate a table of contents for the page, and the `fuse.js` library is used for search functionality.\n\nHere's an example of how the `DevelopmentClient` class can be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nconst client = new DevelopmentClient(\"https://example.com/aleo-server\");\n```\n\nThis creates a new instance of the `DevelopmentClient` class, which can then be used to interact with the Aleo Development Server at the specified URL.",
