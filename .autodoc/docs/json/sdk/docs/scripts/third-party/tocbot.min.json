  "summary": "This code is part of the `aleo` project and provides functionality for generating a table of contents (TOC) based on the headings present in a given HTML content. The TOC is generated as a nested list of links, allowing users to easily navigate through the content by clicking on the desired heading.\n\nThe code consists of three main parts:\n\n1. `ParseContent`: This function is responsible for parsing the HTML content and extracting the headings. It takes into account various options such as ignoring certain selectors, including HTML content, and handling hidden elements. The extracted headings are then organized into a nested array based on their heading levels.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   var parsedContent = ParseContent(options);\n   var headingsArray = parsedContent.nestHeadingsArray(headings);\n   ```\n\n2. `BuildHtml`: This function is responsible for generating the TOC HTML structure based on the nested headings array. It creates a nested list of links with appropriate classes and attributes, such as active link and collapsible list classes. It also provides methods for updating the TOC when the user scrolls through the content.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   var htmlBuilder = BuildHtml(options);\n   var tocElement = htmlBuilder.render(tocContainer, headingsArray);\n   ```\n\n3. `tocbot`: This is the main object that exposes the public API for initializing, refreshing, and destroying the TOC functionality. It combines the functionality of `ParseContent` and `BuildHtml` to generate the TOC and attach the necessary event listeners for updating the TOC as the user scrolls through the content.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   tocbot.init({\n     tocSelector: '.js-toc',\n     contentSelector: '.js-content',\n     headingSelector: 'h1, h2, h3',\n   });\n   ```\n\nIn the larger project, this code can be used to automatically generate a table of contents for any HTML content with headings, making it easier for users to navigate through the content and improving the overall user experience.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `defaultOptions` object and what are the available options?\n   **Answer**: The `defaultOptions` object contains the default configuration options for the tocbot library. These options include settings for selectors, classes, scroll behavior, and rendering options, among others.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `ParseContent` function work and what does it return?\n   **Answer**: The `ParseContent` function takes a configuration object as an argument and returns an object with two methods: `nestHeadingsArray` and `selectHeadings`. These methods are used to parse the content of the page, select the headings based on the provided configuration, and nest them in a hierarchical structure.\n\n3. **Question**: How can a developer customize the behavior of the tocbot library, such as changing the scroll duration or using a different selector for headings?\n   **Answer**: A developer can customize the behavior of the tocbot library by passing a configuration object with the desired options when calling `tocbot.init()`. For example, to change the scroll duration, they can pass an object with the `scrollSmoothDuration` property set to the desired value. Similarly, to use a different selector for headings, they can pass an object with the `headingSelector` property set to the desired selector."
