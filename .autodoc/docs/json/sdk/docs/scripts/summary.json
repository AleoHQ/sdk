The primary functionalities include theme toggling, accordion behavior, font size adjustment, and code block interactions.\n\n1. **Theme Toggling**: The `toggleTheme` function is responsible for switching between dark and light themes. It updates the `data-theme` attribute, the class list of the body element, and the localStorage to store the user's theme preference.\n\n2. **Accordion Behavior**: The `initAccordion` function initializes the accordion behavior for the sidebar sections. It sets up click event listeners for each sidebar section title and toggles the `data-isopen` attribute to expand or collapse the section. The accordion state is stored in localStorage to persist the user's preference.\n\n3. **Font Size Adjustment**: The code provides functions to increment, decrement, and reset the font size of the content. The font size is stored in localStorage to remember the user's preference. A tooltip is also provided for the font size adjustment controls.\n\n4. **Code Block Interactions**: The code adds features to the code blocks, such as syntax highlighting using the `hljs` library, line numbering, and a copy-to-clipboard button. It also adds anchor links to headings for easy navigation and sharing.\n\n5. **Table of Contents**: The code hides the table of contents on source pages and brings the selected section into view when the page loads or when the URL hash changes.\n\n6. **Mobile Menu**: The code initializes the mobile menu and sets up click event listeners to show or hide the mobile menu.\n\n7. **Miscellaneous**: The code also includes functions for fixing table layouts, adding href attributes to sidebar titles, and initializing tooltips for various UI elements.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\n// Toggle theme\ntoggleTheme();\n\n// Increment font size\nincrementFont(event);\n\n// Decrement font size\ndecrementFont(event);\n\n// Reset font size\nupdateFontSize(16);\n```",
      "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `toggleTheme` function and how does it work?\n   **Answer**: The `toggleTheme` function is used to switch between the dark and light themes of the webpage. It gets the current theme from the body's `data-theme` attribute, determines the new theme, and then calls the `updateTheme` function to apply the new theme.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `initAccordion` function work and when is it called?\n   **Answer**: The `initAccordion` function initializes the accordion functionality for the sidebar sections. It is called when the DOM content is loaded. It sets up event listeners for the sidebar section titles and toggles the accordion state based on the stored accordion IDs in the local storage.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `bringElementIntoView` function work and what is its purpose?\n   **Answer**: The `bringElementIntoView` function is used to scroll the specified element into the viewport. It calculates the offset based on the navbar's height and scrolls the body accordingly. It also has an optional parameter `updateHistory` which, when set to true, updates the browser's history with the element's ID."

      "summary": "This code is responsible for handling various user interface (UI) functionalities in the Aleo project, such as theme toggling, accordions, font size adjustments, and more. The code is organized into several functions that perform specific tasks, and these functions are called at appropriate times to provide a smooth user experience.\n\n1. **Theme Toggling**: The `toggleTheme` function is responsible for switching between dark and light themes. It updates the `data-theme` attribute of the `body` element and the `xlink:href` attribute of the theme icons. The current theme is stored in the local storage using the `updateTheme` function.\n\n   Example usage: `toggleTheme()`\n\n2. **Accordion**: The `initAccordion` function initializes the accordion functionality in the sidebar. It sets up event listeners for the `.sidebar-section-title` elements and toggles the accordion state using the `toggleAccordion` function. The accordion state is stored in the local storage.\n\n3. **Font Size Adjustment**: The `incrementFont`, `decrementFont`, and `updateFontSize` functions handle font size adjustments. Users can increase or decrease the font size within a specified range (10px to 30px). The current font size is stored in the local storage.\n\n   Example usage: `incrementFont()`, `decrementFont()`\n\n4. **Anchor Links**: The `addAnchor` function adds anchor links to headings (h1, h2, h3, h4) within the main content section. The `createAnchorElement` function creates an anchor element with the appropriate event listener for smooth scrolling.\n\n5. **Table of Contents**: The `bringElementIntoView` function is responsible for smooth scrolling to a specific element in the table of contents. It updates the URL hash and the active element in the table of contents.\n\n6. **Tooltips**: The `initTooltip` function initializes tooltips for various UI elements like theme toggle, search button, font size adjustment, and more using the `tippy` library.\n\n7. **Mobile Menu**: The `initMobileMenu` function sets up the event listener for the mobile menu button. The `onMobileMenuClick` function toggles the mobile menu's visibility.\n\n8. **Miscellaneous**: The code also handles other UI tasks like fixing tables, adding href to sidebar titles, and initializing syntax highlighting using the `hljs` library.\n\nThe code is executed when the DOM is fully loaded, and event listeners are set up for various UI elements. The current theme and font size are retrieved from the local storage and applied to the page.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `toggleTheme` function and how does it work?\n   **Answer:** The `toggleTheme` function is used to switch between dark and light themes. It checks the current theme by getting the `data-theme` attribute of the document body and updates the theme by calling the `updateTheme` function with the opposite theme (dark or light).\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `initAccordion` function work and what is its purpose?\n   **Answer:** The `initAccordion` function initializes the accordion functionality for the sidebar sections. It first checks if the `accordionLocalStorageKey` exists in the local storage and sets it to an empty object if not. Then, it adds click event listeners to all sidebar section titles, which toggle the accordion state (open or closed) and update the local storage accordingly.\n\n3. **Question:** How is the font size adjusted using the `incrementFont`, `decrementFont`, and `updateFontSize` functions?\n   **Answer:** The `incrementFont` and `decrementFont` functions are used to increase or decrease the font size by 1 unit, respectively, within the defined limits (MIN_FONT_SIZE and MAX_FONT_SIZE). The `updateFontSize` function is called with the new font size value, which updates the font size of the HTML element and stores the new value in the local storage."

      "summary": "This code is responsible for handling the resizing of a navigation bar (navbar) in a web application. The main purpose of this code is to allow users to adjust the width of the navbar within a specified range and store the user's preference in the browser's local storage for future visits.\n\nThe code starts by defining a global variable `NAVBAR_OPTIONS` and an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to encapsulate the logic. Inside the IIFE, it first retrieves the DOM elements for the navbar, footer, and main section of the page. It then checks if there is a saved width value in the local storage under the key `NAVBAR_RESIZE_LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY`. If a value is found, it applies the saved width to the navbar, main section, and footer.\n\nThe `resizeNavbar` function is responsible for resizing the navbar based on the user's input. It takes an event object as an argument and calculates the new width based on the event's `pageX` property. The new width is then checked against the minimum and maximum allowed values (defaulting to 300 and 600, respectively) specified in `NAVBAR_OPTIONS`. If the new width is within the allowed range, it is applied to the navbar, main section, and footer.\n\nThe `setupEventListeners` function adds event listeners for `mousemove` and `touchmove` events to the window, which call the `resizeNavbar` function. The `removeEventListeners` function removes these event listeners and calls `afterRemovingEventListeners`, which saves the current navbar width to local storage.\n\nFinally, the code sets up event listeners for `mousedown` and `touchstart` events on the navbar slider, which call the `setupEventListeners` function, and a `mouseup` event on the window, which calls the `removeEventListeners` function. The `setupResizeOptions` function is provided to allow external code to set the `NAVBAR_OPTIONS` object.\n\nIn the larger project, this code would be used to provide a customizable user interface, allowing users to adjust the width of the navigation bar according to their preferences.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `NAVBAR_OPTIONS` object and how can it be configured?**\n\n   The `NAVBAR_OPTIONS` object is used to store configuration options for the navbar resizing functionality, such as the minimum and maximum allowed width. It can be configured by calling the `setupResizeOptions(options)` function and passing an object with the desired options.\n\n2. **Why is this file marked as `@deprecated` and what are the implications of using deprecated code?**\n\n   The file is marked as `@deprecated` because it may no longer be maintained or supported, and it might be removed in future updates. Using deprecated code can lead to potential issues, such as compatibility problems or lack of support for newer features.\n\n3. **How does the code handle touch events for resizing the navbar on touch-enabled devices?**\n\n   The code handles touch events by adding event listeners for `touchmove` and `touchstart` events, which call the same `resizeNavbar` function as the corresponding mouse events. This allows the resizing functionality to work on touch-enabled devices as well as those using a mouse."

      "summary": "This code is responsible for implementing a search functionality in the Aleo project. It provides an interactive search experience by fetching data, filtering results based on user input, and displaying the results in a user-friendly manner.\n\nThe main functions in this code are:\n\n1. `showResultText(text)`: Displays the given text in the `resultBox` element.\n2. `hideSearch()`: Hides the search container and removes the event listener for the 'Escape' key.\n3. `listenCloseKey(event)`: Listens for the 'Escape' key press and hides the search container when pressed.\n4. `showSearch()`: Displays the search container, adds the event listener for the 'Escape' key, and focuses on the search input.\n5. `fetchAllData()`: Fetches the search data from the server and returns it as a list.\n6. `onClickSearchItem(event)`: Handles the click event on a search result item and brings the corresponding element into view.\n7. `buildSearchResult(result)`: Builds the HTML output for the search results.\n8. `getSearchResult(list, keys, searchKey)`: Filters the search data based on the given search key and returns the filtered results.\n9. `debounce(func, wait, immediate)`: Debounces the given function to prevent excessive calls.\n10. `search(event)`: Handles the search functionality by fetching data, filtering results, and displaying them in the `resultBox`.\n\nThe code also includes event listeners for DOMContentLoaded and hashchange events. The `onDomContentLoaded()` function initializes the search functionality by adding event listeners to the search button, search container, search wrapper, and search input. The hashchange event listener calls the `showSearch()` function when the window location hash matches the `searchHash`.\n\nHere's an example of how the search functionality works:\n\n1. User clicks on the search button, triggering the `showSearch()` function.\n2. The search container is displayed, and the search input is focused.\n3. User types a query in the search input, triggering the debounced `search()` function.\n4. The search function fetches data, filters results based on the query, and displays the results in the `resultBox`.\n5. User clicks on a search result item, triggering the `onClickSearchItem()` function, which brings the corresponding element into view.\n6. User presses the 'Escape' key or clicks outside the search wrapper, triggering the `hideSearch()` function, which hides the search container.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `searchId` and `searchHash` constants?\n   **Answer:** The `searchId` constant is a unique identifier for the search feature, and `searchHash` is created by concatenating a hash symbol with the `searchId`. These constants are used to manage the browser's history and hash change events when showing or hiding the search feature.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `fetchAllData` function work, and what does it return?\n   **Answer:** The `fetchAllData` function fetches search data from a JSON file located at `data/search.json` relative to the base URL. It returns a Promise that resolves to an array of search data items (the `list` property of the fetched JSON object).\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `debounce` function, and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer:** The `debounce` function is a utility function that limits the rate at which a function can be called. It is used in the code to create a debounced version of the `search` function, which is then used as an event listener for the `keyup` event on the `searchInput` element. This ensures that the search function is not called too frequently, improving performance and reducing the number of unnecessary search requests."

It uses the Fuse.js library to create an index and perform a fuzzy search on the data based on the search options and query string. It returns the search results, limited to a maximum of 20 items.\n\n3. **Question:** How is the search functionality debounced and what is the purpose of debouncing in this context?\n   **Answer:** The search functionality is debounced using the `debounce` function, which takes a function (`t`), a delay in milliseconds (`n`), and a boolean flag (`a`). Debouncing is used in this context to limit the frequency of calling the search function while the user is typing in the search input, improving performance and reducing unnecessary calls to the search function."

It is particularly useful for searching through large datasets, where exact matches may not always be possible or practical.\n\nThe library exposes a `Fuse` constructor that accepts a collection of data and an options object. The options object allows users to customize various aspects of the search, such as case sensitivity, scoring, and tokenization. The main functionality of the library is provided by the `search` method, which takes a search query and returns an array of results sorted by relevance.\n\nThe code is organized into several classes and functions that handle different aspects of the search process:\n\n- `E`: Represents an index of the data collection, which is used to speed up searches. It provides methods for adding and removing items, as well as searching for matches.\n- `N`: Represents a search pattern and provides methods for searching within a string or an object.\n- `D`: A base class for search strategies, which are used to search for matches using different algorithms. Several subclasses are provided, such as `K` (exact match), `B` (include match), `W` (prefix-exact match), and `V` (fuzzy match).\n- `X`: A function that parses a search query and returns an array of search strategies.\n- `Z`: A search strategy that uses extended search syntax, allowing users to combine multiple search strategies in a single query.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the library:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];\nconst options = { includeScore: true, threshold: 0.4 };\nconst fuse = new Fuse(data, options);\n\nconst results = fuse.search('aple');\n// Results: [{ item: 'apple', refIndex: 0, score: 0.25 }]\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `Fuse` instance with a collection of fruit names and a custom threshold for fuzzy matching. We then search for the string 'aple', which returns a single result with a score indicating the relevance of the match.",

The TOC is generated as a nested list of links, allowing users to easily navigate through the content by clicking on the desired heading.\n\nThe code consists of three main parts:\n\n1. `ParseContent`: This function is responsible for parsing the HTML content and extracting the headings. It takes into account various options such as ignoring certain selectors, including HTML content, and handling hidden elements. The extracted headings are then organized into a nested array based on their heading levels.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   var parsedContent = ParseContent(options);\n   var headingsArray = parsedContent.nestHeadingsArray(headings);\n   ```\n\n2. `BuildHtml`: This function is responsible for generating the TOC HTML structure based on the nested headings array. It creates a nested list of links with appropriate classes and attributes, such as active link and collapsible list classes. It also provides methods for updating the TOC when the user scrolls through the content.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   var htmlBuilder = BuildHtml(options);\n   var tocElement = htmlBuilder.render(tocContainer, headingsArray);\n   ```\n\n3. `tocbot`: This is the main object that exposes the public API for initializing, refreshing, and destroying the TOC functionality. It combines the functionality of `ParseContent` and `BuildHtml` to generate the TOC and attach the necessary event listeners for updating the TOC as the user scrolls through the content.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   tocbot.init({\n     tocSelector: '.js-toc',\n     contentSelector: '.js-content',\n     headingSelector: 'h1, h2, h3',\n   });\n   ```\n\nIn the larger project, this code can be used to automatically generate a table of contents for any HTML content with headings, making it easier for users to navigate through the content and improving the overall user experience.",
