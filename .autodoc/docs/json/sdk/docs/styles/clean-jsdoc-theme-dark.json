  "summary": "This code is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that defines the styling and appearance of various HTML elements in the Aleo project. The purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and visually appealing design across the entire project.\n\nThe CSS file covers a wide range of elements, including text, links, headings, sidebars, navigation bars, footers, tables, code blocks, blockquotes, and search components. It also includes styling for syntax highlighting in code blocks using the `hljs` (highlight.js) library.\n\nFor example, the `body` element has a dark background color (`#1a1a1a`) and white text color (`#fff`). Links (`a` elements) have a blue color (`#00bbff`) and change to a darker blue when active. Headings (`h1` to `h6`) have a white color.\n\nThe sidebar has a dark background color (`#222`) and a lighter text color (`#999`). When hovering over a sidebar section title, the background color changes to `#252525`. The navigation bar has a similar dark background color (`#1a1a1a`) and lighter text/icons color (`#999`). When hovering over a navigation item, the background color changes to `#202020`.\n\nCode blocks have a dark background color (`#333`) and use various colors for syntax highlighting, such as `#ff7b72` for keywords and `#30ac7c` for template variables.\n\nThe CSS file also includes styling for scrollbars, with a dark track color (`#333`) and a slightly lighter thumb color (`#555`).\n\nOverall, this CSS file contributes to the Aleo project by providing a visually appealing and consistent design for various elements, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the project.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `::selection` CSS rule in this code?\n   **Answer:** The `::selection` CSS rule is used to style the text that is selected by the user. In this case, it sets the background color to `#ffce76` and the text color to `#222` when the text is selected.\n\n2. **Question:** How does this code handle styling for different heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.)?\n   **Answer:** This code applies the same styling to all heading levels (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6) by setting their text color to `#fff` (white).\n\n3. **Question:** How does this code style the scrollbar?\n   **Answer:** This code styles the scrollbar using the `::-webkit-scrollbar-track` and `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` pseudo-elements. The scrollbar track has a background color of `#333`, while the scrollbar thumb has a background color of `#555` and an outline of `0.06125rem` solid `#555`."
