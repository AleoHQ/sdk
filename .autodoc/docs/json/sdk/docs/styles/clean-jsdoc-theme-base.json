  "summary": "This code is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that defines the styling and layout for the Aleo project's web pages. It is responsible for the visual appearance of the project, including typography, colors, layout, and responsive design for different screen sizes.\n\nThe code starts by defining custom font faces for headings, body text, and code snippets using the `@font-face` rule. It then sets some global styles, such as box-sizing, margin, padding, and font properties for various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.\n\nThe code also includes styles for specific components and sections of the web pages, such as badges, blockquotes, tables, and code blocks. For example, it defines the appearance of tables with proper spacing, border-radius, and sticky headers. It also styles code blocks with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and a copy-to-clipboard button.\n\nThe layout of the web pages is designed using Flexbox, with a fixed sidebar on the left, a top navigation bar, and a main content area that adjusts its padding based on the screen size. The code also includes styles for a table of contents (TOC) on the right side of the screen, which is hidden on smaller screens.\n\nThe CSS file also includes styles for a search functionality, with a fixed search container, input box, and search results. Additionally, it provides styles for a mobile menu icon and a mobile sidebar, which are only displayed on smaller screens.\n\nIn summary, this CSS file is responsible for the overall look and feel of the Aleo project's web pages, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across different devices and screen sizes.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What are the custom font faces being used in this project and where are they being loaded from?\n   **Answer**: There are three custom font faces being used in this project: 'heading', 'body', and 'code'. They are being loaded from the '../fonts/' directory with the respective font files: 'WorkSans-Bold.ttf', 'OpenSans-Regular.ttf', and 'Inconsolata-Regular.ttf'.\n\n2. **Question**: How are the styles for different heading levels (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) defined in this code?\n   **Answer**: The styles for different heading levels are defined by setting the 'font-family' to 'heading', 'font-weight' to 'normal', and 'line-height' to 1.75. Each heading level also has a specific 'font-size' and some have a 'margin' defined.\n\n3. **Question**: How are the styles for the sidebar and table of contents (toc) being handled in this code for different screen sizes?\n   **Answer**: The styles for the sidebar and table of contents are being handled using media queries. For screens with a width of 100em or less, the 'toc-container' is hidden, and the 'main-content' padding is adjusted. For screens with a width between 65em and 100em, the 'mobile-sidebar-container' is hidden, and the 'navbar-container' is adjusted. For screens with a width of 65em or less, the 'sidebar-container' is hidden, and the 'main-content', 'navbar-container', and 'footer' are adjusted accordingly."
