  "summary": "The code in this file defines a WebAssembly (WASM) representation of an Aleo function execution response. This is useful when interacting with Aleo functions off-chain, as it provides a way to retrieve the outputs of the function execution in a format that can be easily used in a web environment.\n\nThe `ExecutionResponse` struct is a wrapper around the native `ResponseNative` type, which is imported from the `crate::types` module. The `ExecutionResponse` struct implements the `Deref` trait, allowing it to be dereferenced to its inner `ResponseNative` type.\n\nThe `ExecutionResponse` struct provides a single method, `get_outputs`, which returns a `js_sys::Array` containing the outputs of the executed function. This method iterates over the outputs of the native response, converting each output to a `JsValue` and adding it to the array. This makes it easy to work with the outputs in JavaScript code.\n\nAdditionally, the `ExecutionResponse` struct implements the `From` trait for both `ResponseNative` and `ExecutionResponse`. This allows for easy conversion between the native and WASM representations of the execution response.\n\nHere's an example of how the `ExecutionResponse` struct might be used in a larger project:\n\n```rust\n// Assume we have a function `execute_aleo_function` that takes some input and returns a ResponseNative\nlet native_response: ResponseNative = execute_aleo_function(input);\n\n// Convert the native response to a WASM-compatible ExecutionResponse\nlet wasm_response: ExecutionResponse = ExecutionResponse::from(native_response);\n\n// Retrieve the outputs as a JavaScript array\nlet outputs: js_sys::Array = wasm_response.get_outputs();\n\n// Now the outputs can be easily used in JavaScript code\n```",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `ExecutionResponse` struct and how is it used?**\n\n   The `ExecutionResponse` struct is a WebAssembly representation of an Aleo function execution response. It is returned by the execution of an Aleo function off-chain and provides methods for retrieving the outputs of the function execution.\n\n2. **How does the `get_outputs` method work and what does it return?**\n\n   The `get_outputs` method iterates through the outputs of the executed function and creates a new JavaScript array with the outputs as strings. It returns this JavaScript array.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `Deref` implementation for `ExecutionResponse`?**\n\n   The `Deref` implementation for `ExecutionResponse` allows the struct to be automatically dereferenced to its inner `ResponseNative` type, providing access to the methods and fields of `ResponseNative` directly on an `ExecutionResponse` instance."
