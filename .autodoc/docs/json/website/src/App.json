  "summary": "This code is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that is responsible for styling specific elements within the Aleo project. CSS is used to control the appearance of HTML elements on a web page, such as colors, fonts, and layout.\n\n1. **Logo styling**: The `.logo` class is used to style the logo element. It sets the logo to float on the left side of its container and defines its width and height. The `.logo:before` pseudo-element is used to insert the text \"Aleo SDK\" before the content of the logo element. It sets the text color to white, font size to 20px, and font weight to bold. This ensures that the logo is displayed consistently across the project.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```html\n   <div class=\"logo\"></div>\n   ```\n\n2. **Input (disabled) styling**: The `input[type=\"text\"]:disabled` selector targets disabled text input elements. It sets the cursor to the text type, making the input box appear as if it is not disabled. This is useful for providing a better user experience when interacting with disabled input elements.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```html\n   <input type=\"text\" disabled>\n   ```\n\n3. **Copy to clipboard icon formatting**: The `.ant-input-group-addon:last-child` selector targets the last child element with the `ant-input-group-addon` class. It sets the border radius to 20px and width to 42px, giving the copy to clipboard icon a rounded appearance and consistent sizing. This ensures that the icon is visually appealing and easy to interact with.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```html\n   <div class=\"ant-input-group-addon\">\n     <i class=\"copy-to-clipboard-icon\"></i>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\nOverall, this CSS file contributes to the visual consistency and user experience of the Aleo project by styling key elements such as the logo, disabled input fields, and copy to clipboard icons.",
