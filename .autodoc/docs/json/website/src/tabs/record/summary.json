      "summary": "The `DecryptRecord` component in this code is responsible for decrypting a given ciphertext using a provided view key. It is a React functional component that uses the `useState` hook for managing state and the custom `useAleoWASM` hook for interacting with the Aleo WASM library.\n\nThe component renders a form with two input fields: one for the ciphertext and another for the view key. It also provides a \"Demo\" button to populate the form with sample data, and a \"Clear\" button to clear the form. When the ciphertext or view key is changed, the `onCiphertextChange` and `onViewKeyChange` functions are called, respectively. These functions update the state and call the `tryDecrypt` function.\n\nThe `tryDecrypt` function attempts to decrypt the ciphertext using the view key. If successful, it sets the decrypted plaintext and the ownership status to true. If the decryption fails, it checks if the ciphertext is valid and sets the ownership status to false. If the ciphertext is invalid, it sets the ownership status to null.\n\nThe component renders a `Card` containing the form and the decrypted plaintext. If the decryption is successful, the plaintext is displayed in a disabled `Input.TextArea` component, along with a `CopyButton` to copy the plaintext to the clipboard. If the decryption is in progress or has not yet been attempted, a `Skeleton` component is displayed as a placeholder.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger Aleo project to provide a user interface for decrypting records, allowing users to view the plaintext content of a record if they have the correct view key.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `useAleoWASM` hook?**\n\n   The `useAleoWASM` hook is likely used to interact with the Aleo WASM library, providing necessary functions and utilities for the Aleo project. It is used in the `DecryptRecord` component to perform decryption and other related operations.\n\n2. **How does the `tryDecrypt` function work, and what are its possible outcomes?**\n\n   The `tryDecrypt` function takes a ciphertext and a view key as input, and attempts to decrypt the ciphertext using the view key. If the decryption is successful, it sets the plaintext and the `_isOwner` state to true. If the decryption fails, it checks if the ciphertext is valid and sets the `_isOwner` state to false. If the ciphertext is invalid, it sets the `_isOwner` state to null.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `populateForm` and `clearForm` functions?**\n\n   The `populateForm` function is used to pre-fill the form with demo data for the record ciphertext and view key, and then attempts to decrypt the ciphertext using the provided view key. The `clearForm` function is used to clear all the form fields and reset the states for ciphertext, view key, plaintext, and `_isOwner`."

When rendered, the user will see a form with input fields for the ciphertext and view key, as well as the \"Demo\" and \"Clear\" buttons. The user can input their ciphertext and view key, or use the \"Demo\" button to populate the form with sample data. After inputting the required information, the component will attempt to decrypt the ciphertext and display the decrypted plaintext if successful.",
