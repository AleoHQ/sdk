  "summary": "The `SignMessage` component in this code is responsible for signing a message using a private key. It is a React functional component that utilizes the `useState` hook for managing state and the `useAleoWASM` custom hook for interacting with the Aleo WASM library.\n\nThe component renders a form with two input fields: one for the private key and another for the message to be signed. When the user enters a private key, the `onKeyChange` function is called, which attempts to create a `PrivateKey` object from the input string using the `aleo.PrivateKey.from_string` method. If successful, the `signingAccount` state is updated with the new `PrivateKey` object.\n\nWhen the user enters a message, the `onMessageChange` function is called. This function sets the `message` state and attempts to sign the message using the `signString` function. The `signString` function takes a string as input and returns the signature as a string by calling the `sign` method on the `signingAccount` object and converting the result to a string using the `to_string` method.\n\nThe component renders a `Card` containing the form with the input fields for the private key and message. If a valid private key and message are provided, a `Divider` and a `Form.Item` containing the signature are displayed. The signature input field is disabled and has a `CopyButton` component as an addon, allowing the user to easily copy the signature.\n\nHere's an example of how the `SignMessage` component might be used in the larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { SignMessage } from './aleo/SignMessage';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Sign a Message with Aleo</h1>\n      <SignMessage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis component can be used in the Aleo project to provide users with a simple interface for signing messages using their private keys.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `useAleoWASM` hook in this code?\n   **Answer**: The `useAleoWASM` hook is used to access the Aleo WASM library, which provides cryptographic functions for the Aleo project. It is used in this code to create a PrivateKey instance and sign messages.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `onKeyChange` function handle errors when creating a PrivateKey instance from the input string?\n   **Answer**: The `onKeyChange` function uses a try-catch block to handle errors when creating a PrivateKey instance. If an error occurs, it logs the error to the console and sets the `signingKey` and `message` states to null.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `signString` function and how does it handle empty strings or null `signingAccount` values?\n   **Answer**: The `signString` function is used to sign a given string using the current `signingAccount` (PrivateKey instance). If the input string is empty or the `signingAccount` is null, the function returns without performing any signing operation."
