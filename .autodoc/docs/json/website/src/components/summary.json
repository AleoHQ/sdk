      "summary": "The `CopyButton` component in this code snippet is a reusable React component that provides a button with copy-to-clipboard functionality. It can be used in the larger Aleo project to allow users to easily copy specific data to their clipboard with a single click.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook from React to manage its internal state, specifically whether the copy action was successful or not. It initializes the `copySuccess` state to `false` and updates it using the `setCopySuccess` function.\n\nThe `copy` function is responsible for the actual copy-to-clipboard action. It uses the `copyToClipboard` function from the `copy-to-clipboard` library to copy the data passed through the `props` object. After a successful copy, it sets the `copySuccess` state to `true` and schedules a callback to set it back to `false` after 2 seconds using `setTimeout`.\n\nThe component's rendering logic is based on the value of the `copySuccess` state. If the copy action was successful, it renders a `CheckCircleOutlined` icon from the `@ant-design/icons` library, indicating that the data has been copied. Otherwise, it renders a `CopyOutlined` icon, which represents the copy action. Both icons have an `onClick` event handler that triggers the `copy` function when clicked.\n\nTo use this component in the larger project, simply import it and include it in the desired location, passing the data to be copied as a prop:\n\n```jsx\nimport { CopyButton } from \"./path/to/CopyButton\";\n\n// ...\n\n<CopyButton data=\"Text to be copied\" />\n```\n\nThis will render a copy button that, when clicked, copies the specified data to the user's clipboard and provides visual feedback on the success of the action.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `CopyButton` component?**\n\n   The `CopyButton` component is a reusable button that allows users to copy the provided data to their clipboard. When clicked, it changes its icon to indicate a successful copy operation and reverts back to the original icon after 2 seconds.\n\n2. **What are the required props for the `CopyButton` component?**\n\n   The `CopyButton` component requires a single prop called `data`, which is the content that will be copied to the clipboard when the button is clicked.\n\n3. **How does the `copyToClipboard` function work?**\n\n   The `copyToClipboard` function is an imported utility from the `copy-to-clipboard` package. It takes the provided data as an argument and copies it to the user's clipboard."
